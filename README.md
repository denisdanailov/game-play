This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Server

This is REST service, created for educational purposes. A compiled bundle should be available with every exercise's resources. To execute it, run the included start.bat file, or manually open a command prompt and run `node server.js.`

### Authentication

The service is initialized with three users, which can be used for immediate testing:

    peter@abv.bg : 123456
    george@abv.bg : 123456
    admin@abv.bg : admin
